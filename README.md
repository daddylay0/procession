# Procession

`procession` is a fault tolerant, performant, language agnostic background job server.

... or at least it will be, one day. So far it's in the early stages.

- [Server](./server/README.md)
- [Clients](./client/README.md)
- [Housekeeping](./housekeeping/README.md)

# High Level Architecture

- A `procession` server manages jobs using a backing [`redis`](https://redis.io/) database.
- One or more `client` instances push jobs to the server to be processed.
- One or more `client` instances consume jobs from the server.

For more detail, see [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

# Building and running

This project uses [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) for build management.

## Building

Running `cargo build` in the root builds all crates in the workspace, optionally with `--release`.

To list available binaries, execute `cargo build --bin` from the root directory:
```
; cargo build --bin
error: "--bin" takes one argument.
Available binaries:
    bench
    it
    procession
```

Then build the binary you're after directly:
```
; cargo build --bin bench
```

## Running

By default, `cargo run` starts and builds `procession`.

To list available binaries, execute `cargo run --bin` from the root directory:
```
; cargo run --bin
error: "--bin" takes one argument.
Available binaries:
    bench
    it
    procession
```

From there you can run a specific binary:
```
; cargo run --bin procession
